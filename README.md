# 8bp-trainer

A little trainer program that helps you to maneuver your next shot in Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool. This trainer isn't entirely accurate, it will help you to perform better shots in general though.

- Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/daniel-landgraf/8bp-trainer.git`
