# 8bp-trainer

A little trainer program that helps you to maneuver your next shot in Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool. This trainer isn't entirely accurate, it will help you to perform better shots in general though.

## How to use it

- Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/daniel-landgraf/8bp-trainer.git`
- Inside the root directory of the cloned repository:
  - Run `npm install`
  - Run `npm start`
- If necessary, play around with the first two constants in `src/constants.ts` (they represent the highest and lowest possible WebGL coordinates of a ball)
- Happy hacking!
